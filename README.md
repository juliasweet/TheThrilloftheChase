# The Thrill of the Chase (Finding Forest [Fenn's Treasure])

This repo holds my in-progress code for finding Forest Fenn's treasure, including all of the existing location data and cleaning. 

Current sources: "Too Far To Walk", Forest Fenn's poem. 

fennclues.com: A website dedicated to the search. Includes additional clues that Fenn has provided. 

Hot springs data came from National Centers for Environmental Information of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
The canyons data came from Wikipedia and a number of travel resources. (It is still being built.)
